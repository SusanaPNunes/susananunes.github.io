## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

PhD student in Computer Science at the <a target="_blank" href="https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/">Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon</a> (FCUL), conducting research at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lasige.pt/">LASIGE</a>. I am supervised by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~catiapesquita/"> Dr. Catia Pesquita</a> from FCUL.

Interested in Artificial Intelligence with a special interest in the life sciences. I am currently focusing on Explainable AI, researching the application of AI algorithms to explain their decisions and the implementation of AI-driven technologies in the healthcare sector. My goal is to contribute to developing ethical and transparent AI technologies. More specifically, I am working on making deep learning-based drug recommendations for cancer patients more easily understood by clinicians. 


I have previously conducted research in Multi-domain knowledge graph embeddings and Machine Learning algorithms for <a target="_blank" href="https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13326-023-00291-x">gene-disease association prediction</a>.

## Research Interests

I am interested in many topics beyond these and always look forward to collaborations (given the time). If you have a problem you would like to collaborate on, feel free to [contact me].

* Explainable AI
* Deep Learning
* Semantic Similarity
* Knowledge Graphs and Ontologies
* Cognition

## Teaching

## 2022/2023

### Intelligent Systems, Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon

Teaching Theoretical-Pratical classes, offered to different bachelor degrees within the Faculty, in the 2nd Semester.

Class covers Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals, such as search algorithms, going all the way to Machine Learning Fundamentals.

### Advanced Machine Learning, Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon

Teaching Theoretical-Practical classes, offered to all Department of Informatics Masters' Programs in the 2nd Semester.

Class focuses on more advanced topics such as Ensemble Learning, Markov Models, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

### Machine Learning, Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon

Taught Theoretical-Practical classes, offered to 8 Masters Programs and 1 PhD Program in the 1st Semester.

Class focuses on Supervised & Unsupervised Learning fundamentals.

## Science Communication

### LITHME Whole Action Conference @ Jyväskylä, Finland

This invited talk focused on my Masters' Dissertation and EMNLP 2021 Paper, regarding Shortcut Learning and Commonsense Reasoning. Additionally, potential future research paths in the effort to solve this issue and create more cognitively capable machines are discussed.

### Deep Learning Sessions Portugal <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9oEjnSjtPA"><i class="fab fa-youtube"></i></a>

This invited talk focused on my Masters' Dissertation and EMNLP 2021 Paper: Shortcut Learning and Commonsense Reasoning. If you want to learn a bit more about Shortcut Learning, its presence in Commonsense Reasoning and what it could mean for NLP and cognitive AI, might be worth a watch.

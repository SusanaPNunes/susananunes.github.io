## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Hiüëã! I am a PhD student at the <a target="_blank" href="https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/">Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon</a> (FCUL), conducting research at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lasige.pt/">LASIGE</a>. I am supervised by <a target="_blank" href="https://saracmadeira.wordpress.com/">Professor Sara Madeira</a> from FCUL and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.biocomp.unibo.it/piero/">Professor Piero Fariselli</a> from the <a target="_blank" href="https://dms.campusnet.unito.it/do/home.pl">Department of Medical Sciences of the University of Turin</a>.

I am interested in Deep Learning as a field overall and its applicability to many problems. My current research focuses on improving neurodegenerative disease prognosis, with particular attention to ALS and MS, using Deep Learning. More specifically, I am developing Generative Modeling methods for longitudinal medical datasets to enhance the available resources for low-resource chronic diseases.

I have previously conducted research in Natural Language Processing, at the <a target="_blank" href="http://nlx.di.fc.ul.pt/">NLX-Group</a>. My <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nlx-group/study-of-commonsense-reasoning">Msc Dissertation</a>, supervised by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~ahb/">Professor Ant√≥nio Branco</a> to obtain a Masters in Data Science, focused on a particular problem named <a target="_blank" href="https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.113/">Shortcut Learning, specifically when learning commonsense reasoning</a>.

## Research Interests

I am interested in many topics beyond these (like Physics, Psychology, etc.) and am always looking forward to collaborations (given the time). If you have a problem you would like to collaborate on, feel free to [contact me](#contact).

* Natural Language Processing
* Bioinformatics
* Cognition

## Teaching

## 2021/2022

### Intelligent Systems, Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon

Teaching Theoretical-Pratical classes, offered to different bachelor degrees within the Faculty, in the 2nd Semester.

Class covers Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals, such as search algorithms, going all the way to Machine Learning Fundamentals.

### Advanced Machine Learning, Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon

Teaching Theoretical-Practical classes, offered to all Department of Informatics Masters' Programs in the 2nd Semester.

Class focuses on more advanced topics such as Ensemble Learning, Markov Models, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

### Machine Learning, Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon

Taught Theoretical-Practical classes, offered to 8 Masters Programs and 1 PhD Program in the 1st Semester.

Class focuses on Supervised & Unsupervised Learning fundamentals.

## Science Communication

### LITHME Whole Action Conference @ Jyv√§skyl√§, Finland

This invited talk focused on my Masters' Dissertation and EMNLP 2021 Paper, regarding Shortcut Learning and Commonsense Reasoning. Additionally, potential future research paths in the effort to solve this issue and create more cognitively capable machines are discussed.

### Deep Learning Sessions Portugal <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9oEjnSjtPA"><i class="fab fa-youtube"></i></a>

This invited talk focused on my Masters' Dissertation and EMNLP 2021 Paper: Shortcut Learning and Commonsense Reasoning. If you want to learn a bit more about Shortcut Learning, its presence in Commonsense Reasoning and what it could mean for NLP and cognitive AI, might be worth a watch.
